# CAGEfightR_extensions

R functions for 

* calling enhancers from CAGE data in the same way that was done in Andersson et al, 2014, Nature (https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12787)
* subsampling of CAGE data, e.g. for saturation analyses
* decomposition of CAGE tag clusters
* calculation of genomic background (noise) expression
* normalization across libraries versus GC content
* calculation of bias in expression coverage and expression support versus batch

The functions extend the CAGE analysis framework of CAGEfightR (https://github.com/MalteThodberg/CAGEfightR).
