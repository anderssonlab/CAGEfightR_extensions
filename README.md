# CAGEfightR_extensions

R functions for 

* calling enhancers from CAGE data in the same way that was done in Andersson et al, 2014, Nature (https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12787)
* subsampling of CAGE data, e.g. for saturation analyses
* decomposition of CAGE tag clusters

The functions extend the CAGE analysis framework of CAGEfightR (https://github.com/MalteThodberg/CAGEfightR).
